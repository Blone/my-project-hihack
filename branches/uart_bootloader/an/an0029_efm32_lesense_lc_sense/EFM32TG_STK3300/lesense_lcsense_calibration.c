 * @brief
 *   Calibrates an LC sensor on a given channel
 *
 * @details
 *   This function scans a channel until the buffer is full and
 *   uses the last result from the buffer to use as
 *   counter threshold
 *
 * @note
 *   This function assumes that there is no metal near the LC
 *   sensor, that way the number of pulses counted will
 *   be the maximum and can be used as threshold.
 *   If there is metal close the threshold will be lower and
 *   no trigger will occur.
 *   To make sure only the chosen channel is scanned all the
 *   other channels are disabled.
 *
 * @param[in] chIdx
 *   Identifier of the scan channel. Valid range: 0-15.
